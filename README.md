## Capitals:

**[plainlanguage.gov/guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/design/highlight-important-concepts/)**
- PUTTING EVERYTHING IN CAPITAL LETTERS IS NOT A GOOD EMPHASIS TECHNIQUE. ALTHOUGH IT MAY DRAW THE USER’S ATTENTION TO THE SECTION, IT MAKES IT HARDER TO READ. AND ONLINE, IT’S CONSIDERED SHOUTING.



**[gov.uk/guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)**

- Government experts often say that because they’re writing technical or complex content for a specialist audience, they do not need to use plain English. This is wrong.
- Capital letters are harder to read
- As writers, we do not want people to read. We want people to recognise the ‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster.
- Capital letters are reputed to be 13 to 18% harder for users to read. So we try to avoid them.

**[stylemanual.gov.au](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation#capitalise_the_first_word_in_a_sentence_and_in_headings)**
- Do not use all capitals for headings, unless the visual design for the content meets WCAG 2.1 in all respects.

- Do not use all capitals—this format is reserved for DANGER and WARNING signs.

**[Harvard](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/design-readability)**
- Avoid using all caps. Readability is reduced with all caps because all words have a uniform rectangular shape, meaning readers can't identify words by their shape.

**[Low vision accessibility w3c](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#capitalization)**
- Text in all capital letters is more difficult to read for most people, with and without disabilities.

**[visionaustralia.org](https://www.visionaustralia.org/radio/business-consulting/digital-access/blog/typography-in-inclusive-design-part-1)**
- Limit the use of ALL CAPS text
